		Problem: Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem

Introduction

Given a sequence of integer values (a1, a2, a3, ... aN), which can be either
positive or negative, a subsequence of the integers with the maximum
summation is called the maximum subsequence. For example the maximum
subsequence of sequence (-2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2) is (11, -4, 13) with a
summation 20. 

For this problem, you will be given a set of integer sequences. You need
to find the maximum subsequence and the corresponding summation for each
of the sequences. You can assume that each sequence has a unique maximum
subsequence.  

Input

The input to the problem consists of a set of integer sequences, with
each line of the input representing an integer sequence. The integers in
a sequence are separated by a single white space. 

Output  

For each integer sequence, you need to compute the maximum subsequence
and the corresponding summation. Each output line contains the summation
of the maximum subsequence, followed by a ":", followed by a white space
" ", and then followed by the corresponding maximum subsequence.
Integers in the subsequence are separated by a white space. 
The results of the sequences are outputted in the same order as that of
the sequence in the input file (which is redirected to the standard input).

Sample Input
-2 11 -4 13 05 -2
1 13 -33 -5 29 73 -95

Sample Output
20: 11 -4 13
102: 29 73
